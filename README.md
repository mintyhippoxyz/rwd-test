RWD Viewport Testing
==================
When I stumbled upon mattkersley's Responsive Design Testing tool I was inspired to create something even simpler. I took his idea and turned it into a single view that animates the width and height to popular device sizes.

Instructions
==================
+ Drop rwd-test.html into your website's root directory
+ Navigate to yourserver.com/rwd-test.html

If you would like to test other device sizes simply add a new link to the controls like so:

	<a href="#" class="btn" data-width="240" data-height="320">240 &times; 320</a>
